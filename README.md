# Stock-Prediction-Program
Stock price prediction program using machine learning, using datasets of opening and closing prices of TSLA. Used Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.

Still a work in progress. The graphs for opening and closing prices for TSLA are complete. The machine is able to learn with a low percent error. However, final graph is not showing. WIP.
